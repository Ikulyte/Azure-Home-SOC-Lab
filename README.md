## Introduction

Proud to share my first project! I built a honeynet in Azure to simulate cyberattacks and learn how attackers operate. Along the way, I gained practical knowledge in Azure security, incident response, and hardening environments.


## Objective
My project involved deploying a single intentionally vulnerable virtual machine in Azure to observe real cyber attacks. This gave me practical experience with attacker techniques and improved my ability to respond quickly when security issues arose.

## Technologies, Regulations, and Azure Components used:

- Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
- Microsoft Sentinel for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Virtual Machine (Windows)
- Log Analytics Workspace with Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Windows Remote Desktop Connection
- Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
- Azure Storage Account for Data Storage
